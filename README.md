'''Reflection Removal using U-Net


#Overview
This project is a solution for TECHFEST 2024-25 - Qualcomm VisionX Hackathon 

The objective is to create an AI model that removes reflections from photos taken through reflective surfaces, preserving the original scene and details.

#Features

1)Custom U-Net Architecture for precise reflection removal.

2)Robust preprocessing for handling diverse image formats.

3)Outputs high-quality, reflection-free images without blurriness or artifacts.

4)Supports visualization of results and saves outputs for review.
